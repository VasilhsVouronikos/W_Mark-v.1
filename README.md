# W_Mark version 1.0
W_Mark version 1.0 is an application integrating algorithms for watermarking and tamper detection in images. 
The application allows the user to create baches of images so as sequentially to be watermarked with either authenticity information (watermarking) or integrity information (tamper detection & localization).

## Utilies
  * Bach creation (from scrach or from folder)
  * Master folder creation (Many baches may be stored in the same master folder)
  * Establisment of a root save directory (all watermarked images within the folder will be there)
  * Creation of a split number (Meaning that for large baches we can parallelize the watermarking proscess by splitting the bach) - under development
  * Creation of a default robustness parameter (a factor of the aythenticity watermarking proscess)
  * Selection of either marking or validation
